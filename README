The project starts!

To run the project:

1. Run './make_bootstrap.py' to make bootstrap.py
2. Run './bootstrap.py .'  to download the third-party libraries in a virtualenv
3. Run 'source ./bin/activate' to activate the virtualenv
4. Extract data from the Tulsa Transit Authority into the input folder.  We haven't gotten clearance to distribute this data, so please don't check it into the project.
5. Run ./parser.py to parse the input data into the output folder
6. Run 'python transitfeed/feedvalidator.py output/feed/feed.zip' to validate
7. Run 'python transitfeed/schedule_viewer.py output/feed/feed.zip' to view the schedule

Required files for this project
===============================

agency.txt - Required. This file contains information about one or more transit agencies that provide the data in this feed.

stops.txt - Required. This file contains information about individual locations where vehicles pick up or drop off passengers.

routes.txt - Required. This file contains information about a transit organization's routes. A route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single service.

trips.txt - Required. This file lists all trips and their routes. A trip is a sequence of two or more stops that occurs at specific time.

stop_times.txt - Required. This file lists the times that a vehicle arrives at and departs from individual stops for each trip.

calendar.txt - Required. This file defines dates for service IDs using a weekly schedule. Specify when service starts and ends, as well as days of the week where service is available.

To get started:

    ./bootstrap.py .     # Create virtual environment.  The trailing '.' is important
    source bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
    ./convert.py         # Convert from the dBase originals to SQLite output.pdb
    deactivate           # Leave the virtual environment

If bootstrap.py fails, try running ./make_bootstrap.py first.  To

This will convert the Tulsa Transit Authority data in the originals folder to
a sqlite database output.db.

The data is from the Tulsa Transit Authority.  Luke has been in contact with
Jeremy Luttrell and Monique Bizet.  We haven't gotten clearance to make this
data publicly available, so please don't distribute yet.

Here's the text of the email from April 08, 2011:

    Here is the shapefile data for the March 2011 signup. The corrections
    for the stop accuracy for the online trip planner are on the March
    2011 CI signup which will be available in a few weeks. When it is
    ready we will send it to you so your data is as accurate as possible.
