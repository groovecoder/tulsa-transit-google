This project is for converting is the code a transit 'signup' from the
Metropolitan Tulsa Transit Authority (MTTA) into a General Transit Feed
Specification (GTFS), that can be used with other transit software such as
OpenTripPlanner.  Our goal is to get this data onto Google Maps and any other
publicly available transit database.
                
To run the project:

1. Install python, pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper
2. Run `mkvirtualenv ttg` to create the new virtualenv
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the third-party libraries
4. Extract data from the Tulsa Transit Authority into the input folder.  We haven't gotten clearance to distribute this data, so please don't check it into the project.
5. Change to the `ttg_project` folder, copy `local_settings.example.py` to `local_setting.py`, change as needed.
6. Run `./manage.py syncdb; ./manage.py migrate` to create a new database.
6. Run `./manage.py importmttasignup` to import into SignUp #1
6. Run `./manage.py copymttatogtfs 1` to copy SignUp #1 to Feed #1 
7. Run `./manage.py exportgtfs --name feed.zip 1` to export Feed #1 to feed.zip
8. Run `feedvalidator.py feed.zip` to validate the feed
9. Run `schedule_viewer.py feed.zip` to view the schedule
10. Run `/manage.py runserver` to start up Django.  The Django admin may be the only interesting part.
